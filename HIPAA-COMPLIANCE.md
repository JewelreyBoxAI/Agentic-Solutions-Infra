# HIPAA Compliance Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliance features implemented in the Agentic Solutions Infrastructure to ensure proper handling of Protected Health Information (PHI).

## HIPAA Security Rule Requirements & Implementation

### 1. Administrative Safeguards

#### ✅ **Security Officer (§164.308(a)(2))**
- **Implementation**: Designated security contact configured in `azurerm_security_center_contact`
- **Location**: `tenants/hipaa-healthcare/main.tf`
- **Configuration**: Security alerts sent to designated security team email

#### ✅ **Workforce Training (§164.308(a)(5))**
- **Implementation**: Documented procedures and access controls
- **Location**: This documentation and deployment processes
- **Requirements**: All team members must complete HIPAA training before access

#### ✅ **Access Management (§164.308(a)(4))**
- **Implementation**: Azure RBAC with least privilege access
- **Features**:
  - Service Principal authentication
  - Key Vault access policies
  - Network-based access restrictions
  - IP address allowlisting for admin access

### 2. Physical Safeguards

#### ✅ **Workstation Use (§164.310(b))**
- **Implementation**: Azure Container Apps provide isolated compute environments
- **Security**: No direct server access, containerized applications

#### ✅ **Media Controls (§164.310(d)(1))**
- **Implementation**: 
  - Encrypted storage with customer-managed keys
  - Geo-redundant backup storage
  - Automated retention policies (6+ years)

### 3. Technical Safeguards

#### ✅ **Access Control (§164.312(a)(1))**

**Unique User Identification:**
- Azure AD integration for user authentication
- Service Principal for automated access
- Key Vault access policies with specific permissions

**Emergency Access:**
- Break-glass procedures via Azure AD Privileged Identity Management
- Emergency contact configured in Security Center

**Automatic Logoff:**
- Container Apps session timeout
- Azure AD conditional access policies

**Encryption and Decryption:**
- Customer-managed encryption keys in Key Vault
- TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- Encryption at rest for all data stores

#### ✅ **Audit Controls (§164.312(b))**

**Comprehensive Logging:**
```hcl
# All access attempts logged
resource "azurerm_monitor_diagnostic_setting" "keyvault_hipaa" {
  enabled_log {
    category = "AuditEvent"
  }
}

# Database access logging
resource "azurerm_monitor_diagnostic_setting" "cosmos_hipaa" {
  enabled_log {
    category = "DataPlaneRequests"
  }
}
```

**Network Traffic Monitoring:**
```hcl
# Network flow logs for audit trails
resource "azurerm_network_watcher_flow_log" "hipaa_flow_log" {
  retention_policy {
    enabled = true
    days    = 90  # Configurable retention
  }
}
```

#### ✅ **Integrity (§164.312(c)(1))**

**Data Integrity Controls:**
- Cosmos DB automatic indexing and consistency policies
- Backup verification and testing procedures
- Version control for infrastructure changes

**PHI Alteration/Destruction:**
- Audit logs for all data modifications
- Soft delete with recovery capabilities
- Change tracking in Log Analytics

#### ✅ **Person or Entity Authentication (§164.312(d))**

**Multi-Factor Authentication:**
- Azure AD conditional access policies
- Service Principal certificate authentication
- API key management via Key Vault

#### ✅ **Transmission Security (§164.312(e)(1))**

**End-to-End Encryption:**
- HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ for all API communications
- VPN or private endpoints for admin access
- Network security groups with restrictive rules

**Network Protection:**
```hcl
# HTTPS only ingress
resource "azurerm_container_app" "main" {
  ingress {
    allow_insecure_connections = false  # HTTPS only
    external_enabled           = true
  }
}
```

## Enhanced Security Features

### 1. Network Microsegmentation

```bash
# Network architecture for HIPAA compliance:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Virtual Network (10.0.0.0/16)                              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ subnet-infra (10.0.1.0/24)        - Infrastructure         │
│ subnet-agents (10.0.2.0/24)       - Container Apps         │
│ subnet-database (10.0.4.0/24)     - Database tier          │
│ subnet-private-endpoints (10.0.3.0/24) - Private endpoints │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Customer-Managed Encryption

**Key Management:**
- RSA 2048-bit encryption keys
- Key rotation policies
- HSM-backed key storage (Key Vault Premium SKU recommended)

### 3. Private Connectivity

**Private Endpoints:**
- Storage accounts accessible only via private network
- Cosmos DB with VNet integration
- Key Vault with network restrictions

### 4. Backup and Recovery

**HIPAA-Compliant Backup:**
```hcl
# 6+ year retention as required by HIPAA
resource "azurerm_storage_management_policy" "hipaa_retention" {
  rule {
    actions {
      base_blob {
        delete_after_days_since_modification_greater_than = 2190  # 6 years
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Monitoring and Alerting

**Security Monitoring:**
- Real-time alerts for unauthorized access attempts
- Failed authentication monitoring
- Unusual data access patterns
- Network anomaly detection

## Data Classification

All PHI data is tagged with:
```hcl
tags = {
  DataClassification = "PHI"
  Compliance         = "HIPAA"
  SecurityLevel     = "High"
  Purpose           = "Healthcare"
}
```

## Deployment Guide for HIPAA Tenant

### Prerequisites

1. **Security Clearance**: Ensure all personnel have appropriate HIPAA training
2. **Network Configuration**: Set up private network connectivity
3. **Contact Information**: Configure security team contact details

### Deployment Steps

```bash
# 1. Deploy global infrastructure with HIPAA enhancements
cd globals/
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

# 2. Deploy HIPAA-compliant tenant
cd ../tenants/hipaa-healthcare/
terraform init
terraform plan -var="security_contact_email=your-security@company.com"
terraform apply
```

### Configuration Variables

```hcl
# Required HIPAA-specific variables
security_contact_email    = "security@healthcare.example.com"
security_contact_phone    = "+1-555-0123"
admin_ip_addresses       = ["203.0.113.0/24"]  # Your admin IPs
data_retention_days      = 2555  # 7 years (exceeds minimum)
```

## Compliance Validation

### Automated Compliance Checks

1. **Encryption Verification**:
   ```bash
   # Verify all storage is encrypted
   az storage account show --name <storage-account> --query "encryption"
   ```

2. **Network Security Validation**:
   ```bash
   # Check NSG rules
   az network nsg show --name agentic-nsg --resource-group AgenticInfra-rg
   ```

3. **Access Control Audit**:
   ```bash
   # Review Key Vault access policies
   az keyvault show --name <key-vault-name> --query "properties.accessPolicies"
   ```
